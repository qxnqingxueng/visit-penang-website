# Visit Penang 🌴  
Centralized, user-friendly, and information-rich platform dedicated to promoting the beauty and attractions of Penang to tourists worldwide.

## 🔍 Project Overview  
The Visit Penang Web Platform was developed as a central platform to promote Penang’s attractions globally. The site aims to be visually appealing, user-friendly, and information-rich, providing tourists with descriptions and historical context, as well as essential details on tourist spots, food and beverages, and hotels. 

This project was completed as part of the CAT201: Integrated Software Development Workshop at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM). 

## 🌟 Key Features  
The platform is designed to assist tourists comprehensively throughout their trip planning and execution, offering the following main features:

• Comprehensive Information: The website encompasses details on Penang's history, tourist spots, food and beverages, and hotels, alongside a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section.

• Responsive Design: The design utilizes media queries and flexible grid layouts (using the Tailwind CSS framework) to ensure the website is easily adjusted and functional across various screen sizes, including detailed Mobile Views.

• Tourist Spots Guide: Detailed listings categorized by Heritage, Street Art, Natural & Outdoor, and Entertainment. Each tourist spot listing provides crucial details such as address and operating hours, with functionality to switch directly to Google Maps via a 'View On Map' button.
